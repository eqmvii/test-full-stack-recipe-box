# Recipe Box

Each folder is its own horrible hacky npm node directory. I started with Create React App and then made terrible, horrible, no-good choices implementing my own server. Things got bad. 

This is held together with off-brand ductape and prayer never look at the files in this project

never do anything like this

don't look at this

why are you here

please go

thank you

Local testing steps:

CD into back, fire up the server (node app.js)

CD into front, fire up the react app (npm start)

Try not to have too much fun!
